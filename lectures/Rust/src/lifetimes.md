# Lifetimes

In Rust, references are valid for specific regions of code, known as lifetimes.
The borrow checker ensures that references do not outlive the lifetimes of their
owners and that lifetimes mutable references do not overlap with the lifetimes
any other references to the same value.

Most of the time, lifetimes of references are implicit and inferred by the
compiler. For example the following code fails to compile, as the lifetime of
the borrow end before the lifetime of the variable `z`.


```rust, editable
fn main() {
    let z: &Box<(u32, u32)>;

    {
        let y: Box<(u32, u32)> = Box::new((42, 44));

        z = &y;
    } // y's lifetime ends here. y is dropped.

    println!("{:?}", z)
}
```

However, there are situations where lifetime annotations are necessary to
clarify relationships between lifetimes. Consider the following scenario:

```rust, editable
fn first<T>(a: &T, b: &T) -> &T {
    a
}

fn main() {
    let x: Box<(u32, u32)> = Box::new((32, 34));

    let z: &Box<(u32, u32)>;

    {
        let y: Box<(u32, u32)> = Box::new((42, 44));

        z = first(&x, &y);
    } // y's lifetime ends here. y is dropped.

    println!("{:?}", z)
}
```

The function `first` takes two references and returns one of them. However, the
compiler does not know whether the reference returned by first is valid beyond
the lifetime of `y`. Since `z` is assigned the result of first, it could be
referencing `x` (which is valid) or `y` (which is dropped). The compiler will
return an error, because the type of the function `first` does not provide enough
information about how the lifetimes of the inputs relate to the lifetime of the
output.
We can use _generic lifetimes_ to instruct the compiler that the returned
lifetime is the same to some input lifetime.

## Lifetime Annotations

Rust's type systems allows us to give a more rich type to the function first
using _generic lifetime annotations_. Such annotations explicitly define the
relationships between the lifetimes of the function's inputs and output


```rust, editable
fn first<'a, 'b, T>(x: &'a T, y: &'b T) -> &'a T {
    x
}

fn main() {
    let x: Box<(u32, u32)> = Box::new((32, 34));

    let z: &Box<(u32, u32)>;

    {
        let y: Box<(u32, u32)> = Box::new((42, 44));

        z = first(&x, &y);
    } // y's lifetime ends here

    println!("{:?}", z)
}
```

Just as we can add generic type parameters to a function, we can also add
generic lifetime parameters. In the example above, we introduce two lifetime
parameters, `<'a, 'b>`, after the function name. These parameters represent the
lifetimes of the references passed to the function.

Next, we associate these lifetime parameters with the lifetimes of the
references in the function signature. Writing `x: &'a T` (resp. `y: &'b T`)
indicates that the reference `x` has the lifetime `'a` (resp. the reference `y`
has the lifetime `'b`). Furthermore, we specify that the returned reference will
have the same lifetime as `'a`, the lifetime of reference `x.

The function type checks as the borrow checker can verify that the returned
reference has the expected lifetime. The usage of `z` now typechecks as the type
of `first` now carries enough information for the compiler to deduce that the
reference held in `z` after the return is valid at the time of printing it.

The function `first` could have been also given the following type:

```rust, ignore
fn first<'a, T>(x: &'a T, y: &'a T) -> &'a T {
    x
}
```

But in this case, we wouldn't have been able to use the the variable `z` outside
of `y`'s scope.


Let's see a more complicated example that involves vectors. This time the
function `longer` can return either of the the two vectors. Therefore the
lifetime of the returned reference must be the smaller of the two lifetimes.

As an exercise, try to fill in the lifetimes in the example below.

```rust, editable
fn longer<T>(v1: &Vec<T>, v2: &Vec<T>) -> &Vec<T> {
    if v1.len() >= v2.len() {
        v1
    } else {
        v2
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];

    let z: &Vec<u32>;

    {
        let y: Vec<u32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

        z = longer(&x, &y);
        println!("{:?}", z)
    }

    // println!("{:?}", z)
}
```

The reason why the call to `longer` type checks is that Rust does something
called _lifetime coercion_. That means that a longer lifetime can be coerced
into a shorter one.

## Lifetimes in Structs and Enums

When structs or enums hold references, then they also need lifetime annotations
for every reference inside their definition. This ensures that the lifetime of
any field of the struct or enum is at least as long as the lifetime of the
struct itself.

Here's an example that uses Rust
[`slice`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html) data type. The
slice data type is a view into a contiguous block of memory, which is part of a
larger collection like an array or a `Vec`. It is a reference to a segment of
the collection, without owning the data.


```rust, editable
struct Chunks<'a, T> {
    read: &'a [T],
    read_write: &'a mut [T],
}

fn zero_out<'a>(chunks: &mut Chunks<'a, u32>) {
    for i in 0..chunks.read_write.len() {
        chunks.read_write[i] = 0;
    }
}

fn sum<'a>(chunks: &Chunks<'a, u32>) -> u32 {
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in 0..chunks.read.len() {
        sum += chunks.read[i];
    }
    sum
}

fn main() {
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let (read_only, read_write) = v.split_at_mut(2);

    let mut chunks = Chunks {
        read: read_only,
        read_write: read_write,
    };

    println!("Sum of read-only part: {}", sum(&chunks));

    zero_out(&mut chunks);

    println!("After zero_out: {:?}", v);
}
```

Here is an example where it is useful for struct fields to have distinct lifetimes.

```rust, editable
struct Chunks<'a, 'b, T> {
    read: &'a [T],
    read_write: &'b mut [T],
}

fn zero_out<'a, 'b>(chunks: &mut Chunks<'a, 'b, u32>) {
    for i in 0..chunks.read_write.len() {
        chunks.read_write[i] = 0;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut v1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let s;

    {
        let v2 = vec![6, 7, 8];

        let mut chunks = Chunks {
            read: &v2[1..3],
            read_write: &mut v1[2..4],
        };

        zero_out(&mut chunks);

        s = chunks.read_write;
    }

    println!("Slice: {:?}", s);
    println!("After zero_out: {:?}", v1);
}
```

## Elision

In Rust, the borrow checker can infer elided lifetimes in specific cases,
enabling more concise code. These inference rules allow developers to omit
explicit lifetime annotations in many scenarios. The rules are as follows:

- Each elided input lifetime becomes a distinct lifetime parameter.

- If there is exactly one input lifetime position (whether elided or explicitly
  stated), that lifetime is applied to all elided output lifetimes.

- If there are multiple input lifetime positions, but one of them is `&self` or
  `&mut self`, the lifetime of `self` is applied to all elided output lifetimes.

If the borrow checker cannot infer the lifetime relationships using these rules,
explicit lifetime annotations are required.

```rust, editable
struct Example {
    value: i32,
}

impl Example {
    // The method get_value borrows self and returns a reference to its value.
    // The lifetime of &self is inferred to be the same as the returned reference.
    fn get_value(&self) -> &i32 {
        // same as get_value<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a i32
        &self.value
    }
}

fn main() {
    let example = Example { value: 42 };

    println!("The value is: {}", example.get_value());
}
```

The signature of `longest` above requires explicit lifetime annotation as
lifetimes cannot be inferred with the above rules.

## Static

Rust has special lifetime called `'static`. This lifetime represents memory that
lasts for the entire duration of the program's execution.

A reference `&'static T` is an immutable reference to some data that is
guaranteed to be valid and safely accessible for the program's lifetime.


This can typically happen in two ways:

1. The value is hardcoded into the executable.
2. The value is a reference to leaked memory.

### `'static` Lifetime from Constants

Here is an example of the first case:

```rust, editable
fn main() {
    // A string with a 'static lifetime (lives for the program's duration)
    let data: &'static [u32] = &[10, 20, 30];

    // The slice can be used throughout the program
    println!("Static slice: {:?}", data);
}
```

In this example, the slice `&[10, 20, 30]` has a 'static lifetime because it
refers to a constant array embedded in the program's binary. The data remains
valid and accessible for the entire duration of the program.

Rust can promote the lifetime of a temporary value to `'static` under certain
conditions. This happens when the value is constant, immutable, and never
mutated.

```rust, editable
fn foo() -> &'static [u32] {
    &[10, 20, 30]
}

fn main() {
    // A string with a 'static lifetime (lives for the program's duration)
    let data = foo();

    // The slice can be used throughout the program
    println!("Static slice: {:?}", data);
}
```

### Leak

The second way to create a `'static` lifetime is by leaking memory. When memory
is "leaked," it is never deallocated, making it safe to use for the program's
entire execution.

```rust, editable
fn foo() -> &'static [u32] {
    // Create a Vec on the heap
    let dynamic_data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Leak the Vec to produce a static slice
    Box::leak(dynamic_data.into_boxed_slice())
}

fn main() {
    // A slice with a 'static lifetime created via leak
    let data = foo();

    // The slice can be used throughout the program
    println!("Static slice from leak: {:?}", data);
}
```
